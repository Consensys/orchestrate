### Migrate steps from v2.5.x to v21.1.x

> IMPORTANT ! In order to perform this migration, Orchestrate has to be running on the latest minor version of v2.5.x
and been migrated to latest v21.1.x  

#### HashiCorp keys
In order to migrate your keys from `kv-v2` engine to `orchestrate` engine you need to follow the next steps:

1. Instantiate HashiCorp with both engines enabled: `kv-v2` and `orchestrate`
1. Initialize the following environment variables: 
    - `VAULT_ADDR`: HashiCorp host URL 
    - `VAULT_TOKEN_FILE`:  Disk path to token file valid for orchestrate engine
    - `VAULT_MOUNT_POINT`: Mounting point of orchestrate engine
    - `VAULT_V2_SECRET_PATH`: Path where keys are stored in kv-v2 engine 
    - `VAULT_V2_MOUNT_POINT`: Mounting point of kv-v2 engine
    - `VAULT_V2_TOKEN_FILE`:  Disk path to token file valid for kv-v2 engine
1. Execute command: 
```
$> orchestrate key-manager migrate import-secrets
```

#### Orchestrate Service Data
In previous versions of orchestrate each of the API service data was stored in a independent postgres DB. 
Therefore to update to `v21.1.x` you need to import each of service's data by following the next steps for
each of the service DBs you intend to migrate:

1. Initialize the following:
    - `DB_MIGRATION_SERVICE`: Source DB service name. Values are: "chain-registry", "transaction-scheduler" and "contract-registry"
    - `DB_MIGRATION_ADDRESS`: Source DB URL
    - `DB_MIGRATION_DATABASE`: Source DB name
    - `DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME`: Source DB username
    - `DB_MIGRATION_PASSWORD`: Source DB password
1. Execute command:
```
$> orchestrate api migrate copy-db
```
